# AoC2024

Advent of Code 2024

Day 6 part 2 was the first puzzle where the answer wasn't instantaneously solvable with the right algo. I had some troubles with the python negative index pitfall.

TIL: Using python classes takes more time up-front but is easier when it's time to swap the actual input for the sample input. 

Day 9 (defragmentation), part 2 was the hardest so far (for me). I came up with the method just after finishing part 1, which was updating a rle representation (including concatentation of consecutive dot representation). However, I got stuck on debugging the indices and lengths, but finally got there.
